=== About Me

I am a PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof. [https://www.deschutter.info/ Bart De Schutter], Prof. [https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/a.j.j.vandenboom/?cHash=e29f8ef4a6d74d32f988c13324671cf8/ Ton van den Boom], and Dr. [https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.shi-3/ Shengling Shi] at the [https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/delft-center-for-systems-and-control/ Delft Center for Systems and Control], Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. I received the B.S. degree in the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, [http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/ Beihang University] (BUAA), in 2018, and the M.S. degree (with outstanding graduation thesis and Chinese national scholarship) in the Department of Dynamics and Control, Beihang University, in 2021. I was a research assistant in the group of [https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1081/3094.htm/ Dr. Zhang Chen], in the [https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/ Department of Automation], Tsinghua University, China, in 2021.

My PhD research topic is about learning-based control for piecewise affine systems with constraints. I am in the ERC advanced project "A novel control paradigm for large-scale hybrid networks" ([https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101018826/ CLariNet]).

=== Research Interests
- control under constraints
- reinforcement learning
- hybrid systems
- anti-disturbance control
- hybrid systems
- autonomous driving
- flight control
